* [French version](https://github.com/epfl-tools/.github/blob/main/profile/README_fr.md)

## Service management

To keep our organization efficient, all our projects are :
- ✅ entirely open source
- ✅ deployable via a `captain-definition` file (support for Dockerfile and Docker Compose) 
- ✅ if the service is intended for bachelors, in French (including README and documentation)
- ✅ in English if the audience is more global

If you'd like to add your service:
* 💥 create a fork of the [epfl-tools/apps] repository(https://github.com/epfl-tools/apps)
* 💥 modify the `apps.json` file (add your service)
* 💥 open a Pull Request

Please also let us know if you wish to:
* 🚚 move your personal repo to the GitHub organization, and be added to the organization to continue modifying it (preferred)
* ✂️ fork your personal repo to the GitHub organization

In any case, for questions of efficiency, security and maintenance, we will only deploy repositories added in the organization GitHub account.

🔥 Once the Pull Request has been accepted, your service will be automatically deployed to an epfl.tools subdomain with an SSL certificate and automatic deployment with each commit.
